The purpose of this website is to help me secure college offers. The homepage of the website showcases a simple and elegant timeline that demonstrates my progress and accomplishments in learning JS programming from the age of 12 or 13 to 17. This is sufficient evidence to prove that I am fully capable of handling the academic demands of the computer programming major that I am applying for, despite not having received any formal education in Chinese schools and having to rely on GED to demonstrate my high school level.
