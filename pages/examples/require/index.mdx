## Simulating a Simple Implementation of Node.js Module Loading Function

***Coding Period***: *15 year old*

As I began learning Node.js, I found the require function to be quite mysterious. However, as my understanding of programming deepened, I finally began to perceive the fundamental principle inside require: it reads the code from a file, converts it into a function object, and executes it, ultimately returning the modified module object's exported members to the user.

```nodejs
function _require(path) {
  const fs = require('fs');
  var file = fs.readFileSync(path,'UTF8');
  var obj = {exports:{}}
  var newfun=new Function('var [exports,require,module]=arguments;'+file)
  newfun(obj.exports,myrequire,obj);
  return obj.exports;
}
```
