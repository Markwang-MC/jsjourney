***Coding Period***: *16 year old*

By the age of 16, I had attained a solid mastery of the ReactJS and NextJS frameworks. Leveraging the powerful capabilities of these frameworks, I developed a web application for myself aimed at enhancing English reading skills - a complex and practical product-level development. I deployed this application on Vercel, and it continues to run smoothly to this day. Throughout the development of this product, I acquired invaluable experience in software development within real-world environments, including project planning, user experience design, and continuous deployment, among others.
