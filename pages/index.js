              When I was twelve or thirteen years old, under the guidance of my family, I began my journey of learning JS programming. Growing up in an environment surrounded by experienced programmers, including my parents and older sister, has provided me with a unique advantage in my exposure to coding from a young age.

              At the age of fifteen, I challenged myself by rewriting the Express and Hexo frameworks, and with great enthusiasm, I simulated the construction principles of the Nodejs module loading function (require) and the asynchronous handling method (Promise) with my own code.
